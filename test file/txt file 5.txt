ex:3#Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for? 
ans:-jango-admin is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks. This document outlines all it can do.
In addition, manage.py is automatically created in each Django project. It does the same thing as django-admin but also 
sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to your project’s settings.py file.
The django-admin script should be on your system path if you installed Django via pip. If it’s not in your path, ensure you
have your virtual environment activated.
Generally, when working on a single Django project, it’s easier to use manage.py than django-admin. If you need to switch 
between multiple Django settings files, use django-admin with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or the --settings command line option.
The command-line examples throughout this document use django-admin to be consistent, but any example can use manage.py or 
python -m django just as well.

ex:4#What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls
ans:-What are Django URLs A URL is a web address. For example, codespeedy.com is also a URL. In Django, we use URLconf,
which is a set of patterns that Django will try to match the requested URL to find the correct view.
The path method allows returning of an element to be included in URL patterns tuple which will be used as an url pattern. This was introduced in Django version 2.0 along with the re_path() method.

Syntax: 
path(route, view, kwargs=None, name=None)

Example
urls.py:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.conf.urls import url,include
from django.urls import path
from Django_app1 import views
admin.autodiscover()
urlpatterns = [
path('index/',views.template_view,name='template'),
url(r'^myapp/', include('Django_app1.urls')),
url(r'admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
